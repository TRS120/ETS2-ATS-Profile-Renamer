ETS2/ATS Profile Renamer Tool 🚛

A specialized web utility designed to help Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator players rename their profiles correctly.


🛠 How to Rename Your Profile

Convert: Enter your new desired name in the tool and click the Copy button to get the Hex string.

Folder Rename: Navigate to Documents/Euro Truck Simulator 2/profiles and rename the target folder using the copied Hex string.

Internal Update:

Use a decrypter (like SII_Decrypt) on the profile.sii file inside that folder.

Open it with a text editor and find the line profile_name:.

Update it to match your new Plain Text name.

Save: Save the file and launch your game!
